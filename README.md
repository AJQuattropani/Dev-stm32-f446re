# Dev-stm32-f446re

Project for learning the STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE embedded microcontroller board.

TODO:
- Flash an LED on a breadboard next.

CURRENT PROGRAM IS BASED ON:
https://kleinembedded.com/stm32-without-cubeide-part-1-the-bare-necessities/
with differences resulting from differences in board

# Longerm Goal:
To program this board as an input/output device of an STM32MP157D-DK1, with the latter handling network communication to allow for remote control of the device.
Specifically, the current idea is to create a morse code translator from packets containing text coming from other devices, and converting morse code input from a board button to text.
